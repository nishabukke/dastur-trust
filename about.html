                </div>
                <p>To perpetuate the memory of their high priest Sardar Dastur Nosherwan Jamasp, the Parsi Community raised subscriptions to establish Sardar Dastur Nosherwan Girls High School in 1893 at House # 317, Main street, Pune. Later on being presented Bungalow No 3, Arsenal Road (now Moledina Road) by the brothers of the high priest, the school shifted to its present location in 1911, to accommodate a larger number of children, the school underwent expansion when a new building was evicted by the three surviving brothers in the memory of their sister Bai Behmanbai Pestonji Kanga.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, to commemorated the Shams-ul-Ulema Sardar Khan Bahadur Dr. Hoshang Jamasp Dastur, MA Phd, CIE Sardar Dastur Hoshang Boys High School was inaugurated on 8 Jan 1912.</p>

           <section class="about-content section-lg container pt-1">
            <p>In 1929, the Trustees/Board of Management was formally established and registered as Charitable Trust to administer and manage the schools. Over the years, from its humble beginning, the Sardar Dastur Schools have grown to cater to the requirements of the local populace. Nursery and Primary school was added in 1953 and given a new building in 2006. In 1998&nbsp; the Sardar Dastur Hormazdiar High School was founded by the late President Sardar Dastur Hormazdiar Nosherwan Kaikobad Dastur and a new building was provided in 2001. In 2006, with an aim of giving comprehensive all round education and to prepare students for challenges of under graduation, Sardar Dastur Schools Trust started the Sardar Dastur Hormazdiar Junior College.
